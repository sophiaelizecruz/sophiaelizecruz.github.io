My very first coding project was to create a dodgeball game where a character was to dodge a bunch of objects by moving around. If the player were to be touched by one of the balls, the game would end. The balls were to bounce off of the borders and move in the direction of the player.

This was an individual project, so I had implemented everything using functions provided by JavaEZ. Besides working out the graphics, I also had to calculate how the ball would follow the player, as well as implement the character's movements.

I did not have much exposure to programming before this class as I had only done some online tutorials, so this was indeed a challenge. I learned about the importance of coding style, as the spacing was inconsistent and my variables in terms of naming and amount was very sporadic. I also realized the amount of planning and time management that went into such a simple project.
