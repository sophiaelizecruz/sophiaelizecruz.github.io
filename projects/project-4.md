As part of our Capstone project for my high school's second year Graphic Tech class, we were assigned a topic based on the Hawaii State Department of Education's framework Nā Hopena A‘o (HĀ), and tasked to create a magazine using Adobe applications. In groups, we had to work on components of the magazine as well as log down our progress in our fieldwork log.
