TextRealm is an application that I had developed along with three other peers for our final project for our software 
engineering class. The purpose of the site is to allow UH students to easily buy and sell their textbooks to other UH students 
to cut down the cost and stress of buying textbooks. UH students can create an account and view books being sold by other UH 
students, and can also sell textbooks that they own by uploading an entry to the site. Our site allows users to search for 
books based on the book's ISBN-10, the title of the book, or the author of the book. Users are also able to review their 
buying experience with another user by rating and commenting on their experience, in which their response is displayed on the 
site for other users to see. Administrators of the site have the power to view all of the textbooks in the database and can 
delete an entry if it contains inappropriate content. 

This project had presented many challenges as we progressed, such as some team members being unable to fulfill the tasks that 
they were given, and that the circumstances did not allow for us to meet up as frequently as I would have liked.
