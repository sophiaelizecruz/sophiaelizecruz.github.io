Fruitfall is a casual game that I developed with one of my classmates as a culmination of the concepts that we had learned in our ICS 111 class. The user would input the level of difficulty that they would like to play at, and the objective of the game is to collect as many of the falling fruits as you can. If they come in contact with a bomb, their score drops, and if their score drops below zero, the game ends. If the user were to input a numerical difficulty level not listed in the instructions, that resulted in a mini-game where the user would have to avoid falling objects for as long as they could.


After throwing ideas around and planning out the components of the game, I implemented the scoring system, the movements of the character and the falling objects, and my partner had worked on the bombs and a file reading/writing component. After we had worked out the mechanics, settling on a Mario-like theme with the images and the music. I was more comfortable with Java and JavaEZ, so I could focus a lot more on the aesthetics. Having done graphic design for two years in high school, I could implement the skills that I had learned from there alongside the new programming skill set I had acquired during the semester.


Some challenges that we faced were that we had to work out when we would meet to work on the project, as well as plan out the deadlines for each component of our project. There were also occasions where we would have conflicting ideas as to what we wanted our project to be, but we were able to compromise and work things out in a timely manner.
