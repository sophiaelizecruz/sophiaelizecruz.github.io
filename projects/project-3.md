Fruitfall is a casual game that I developed with one of my classmates as a culmination of the concepts that we had learned in our ICS 111 class. The user would input the level of difficulty that they would like to play at, and the objective of the game is to collect as many of the falling fruits as you can. If they come in contact with a bomb, their score drops, and if their score drops below zero, the game ends. Fruitfall is a  simple collection game I developed with one of my classmates as a culmination of the concepts that we had learned in our ICS 111 class.
