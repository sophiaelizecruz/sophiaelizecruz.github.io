Hawaii is teeming with small local businesses that offer a variety of wares from pastries inspired by local flavors to household goods 
and beauty products that prioritize eco-friendly manufacturing and uplift sustainability. Many small businesses were shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many continue to struggle to stay afloat.
This project proposal for my mobile design class is meant to build upon the exisiting 
[Shop Small Hawaii](https://shopsmallhawaii.com/) by reimagining it into a more user-friendly and mobile guide to the small businesses one 
may struggle to find, whether they are new or local to the islands.
