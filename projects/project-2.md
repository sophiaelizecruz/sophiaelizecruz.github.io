For our second project, we were to create a collection game using what we had learned about object-oriented programming. The objective of the game was to have the character that you were controlling collect as many food and drink items being hurled at them as possible. They also had to avoid being hit by the enemy, which would drop their score by a certain amount. If the player's score was to drop below zero, the game would end.

This was an individual project, so I had implemented and designed everything by myself. I chose to do a meme themed game and focused on the details from the BGM to the objects themselves.

From this experience, I learned how to ask smarter questions and continued to work on my problem-solving skills especially with figuring out and implementing the mechanics of the game. This was a fun exercise to help me build up my object-oriented programming skills.
