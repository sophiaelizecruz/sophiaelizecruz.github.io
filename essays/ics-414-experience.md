Well, I did not, until about two weeks ago.

I was excited to take this class after learning that we would have a customer-developer experience and have a local company as our client. To be able to get a semi-
realistic experience of the industry was something that I wanted some exposure to especially with a year of college left after this semester. Such experiences are 
also valuable as they are your talking points during resume reviews and round after round of behavioral interviews. Besides the technical aspects of 
the class such as testing and implementation was a good opportunity to reflect and improve on my soft skills, from learning to effectively present the features of 
the application to the customer to the meetings with my teammates regarding project updates, bugs, and ideas for our application. 

## Thinking Of The Customer

This class has taught me to step back at times, move away from a programmer mindset and consider the customer's perspective. There was a constant scenario that I 
would think about throughout the process: I'm a random Joe or Jill on the street being asked to try out this greenhouse gases tracker. The regular Joe or Jill would 
not want to be squinting at multiple graphs to figure out the difference between their carbon emissions for today versus yesterday. Maybe for the administrative 
side, yes. It is kind of the same as if you are putting together a PowerPoint presentation for a class: no one wants to read a wall of text. To include a lot of 
intricate words and long passages would turn someone off. People seem to like interactive applications: aesthetically pleasing animations and widgets, easy-to-read 
graphs. Something easy to use and easy to understand. One of the biggest takeaways from this class was maintaining a customer-
developer balance. A developer can produce an application with a lot of fancy graphs, complicated widgets, and functionalities, but if it is not tailored towards 
the audience that you are developing the application for, then the time spent creating such components is wasted. Meeting with the customer every two to three weeks 
and receiving their feedback helped in maintaining this mindset. Something that I kept in mind was how they appreciated the simplicity in the components in each of 
the teams' applications. Finding a balance between creating sophisticated yet easy-to-use applications is something that I am working towards, and hope to exhibit 
in other projects down the line.

I contributed to a lot of the user's data page as well as a component that would compare the user's carbon emissions with the average that was calculated using the 
numbers generated from the application's users. Using Chart.js to generate the graphs, I made it such that a pie chart would give the user a summary of their 
mileage per each mode of transportation that they had taken for the month, and a bar graph to generate the cumulative versus user carbon emissions. To display the 
user's data breakdown for the month (i.e. total miles traveled, carbon dioxide produced, etc.), with the aid of one of my teammates, each data field was paired with 
vector art representative of each field and matching to our site's aesthetic. Another user component that was worked on by other members of my group was the leaf 
widget, which would tell the user how close they were to save a certain amount of carbon dioxide with the leaf filling to a certain amount based on that number, as 
well as how many trees it would have taken to absorb their all-time amount of carbon dioxide saved. Similarly, the application would generate a positive 
or negative message if the user was producing more greenhouse gases than making an effort to reduce them by comparing their emission numbers.

## Where to next?

I feel that I have come a long way from my first year, where I had little to no programming experience, but at the same time, I have a lot to learn. At first, it 
was intimidating to move away from the shadow of the Meteor template that we had forked and the safety nets of the introductory software engineering course, so 
moving forward, I want to expose myself to more frameworks and open source tools. We were lucky enough to have someone in our group that was versed in web scraping, 
and it is something that I also want to learn over the summer or later on. On the soft-skill side of things, there were, of course, our ups and downs as a group, 
but I enjoyed working with them and got to work on my team building and communication skills throughout the process. 

There are things that I wish that I had implemented or done throughout the project, but at the same time, they are learning experiences for the future. Finally, I 
am happy that I got a taste of a customer-developer scenario and obtain more exposure to agile project management. Everything from the bi-weekly 
team meetings to communicating with my teammates to having the exposure to front-end and back-end work to figuring out bugs in the calculations and helper functions 
and the code reviews that would help us become much savvier about our code and figuring out how to improve it. It had also helped me to understand the project 
management process a little better. It got to the point where I could talk about it (and it's what helped me to do well during my internship interviews). Looking 
forward, I hope to have the chance to participate in more hands-on, real world experiences like this one before my undergraduate career ends.
