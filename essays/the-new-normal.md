# The New Normal
What has changed in your daily routine?
With UH announcing that we would be switching to online classes until the end of the semester, I was not really bothered by 
the news. For one, that meant that I could wake up a little later instead of having to scramble to get to the bus stop, and I 
could actually sleep inbetween my classes. 


Besides the academic aspects, I was able to work on other things, such as making playlists on my Spotify account, using 
Duolingo to practice my Japanese for class, and attempt to recreate food trends. However, I miss walking to my classes and to 
the food courts, getting some coffee from Dunkin' Donuts every Thursday after ICS 314, and just being outside.

What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?

Thankfully, I do not have many obligations that I have to take on, except for going with my folks to the grocery store to help 
them shop, and just helping my mom set up her PC for work now that she has to work from home. 

How has Covid impacted your ability to learn, not just in ICS 314, but also in any of your other classes?

COVID-19 has made it harder for me to focus in my classes. I do not really have a designated study desk or area at home, so 
the first few days of online classes was a lot of experimenting with places in my house, which resulted in me using my 
nightstand, a blanket, and a folding stool. I also like the face-to-face interactions between me and my friends, as it 
motivates me to work hard in my classes. 

I am concerned for my grades in Algorithms especially since it is one of the hardest classes that I am taking, and 

For my Japanese class and my Philippine Popular Culture class, I really miss the lively environment
-struggling in ICS 311
-Japanese is harder
-harder to meet up for study groups
-harder to meet for PANDAs
What new things have you learned about yourself, your family, your friends, and your community?

For one, I am not as introverted as I think I am.

I usually joke about not wanting to have any social interaction and that I don't mind being alone at home, but social 
distancing has made me realize how much I love being around people, whether it would be engaging in small talk or showing up 
to meetings such as PANDAs. As much as I love being around my folks, I do miss being able to go out for a coffee or some ice 
cream with my friends. 

I also learned that I have friends that fall on all points of this spectrum of social distancing. On one hand, I see some of 
them camping out in their rooms, playing games and urging others to not go out unless its really necessary, while I see others 
gathering with their friends at the pool or at playgrounds sipping their milk tea like any other day. 

-my friends are dumb
-i actually like talking to people
-i am not as introverted as i thought i was
-making dalgona coffee isnt as hard as i thought it was
What changes do you think you need to make in order to move forward successfully?

Some changes that I think that I need to make in order to move forward successfully is to fix my sleep schedule, start my 
homework earlier, as well as make time for myself to relax and interact with my friends. When online classes began, I was 
struggling to get work done during the day because we had just "come back" from Spring Break, so I was still napping during 
the day and still in this relaxed state of mind. I would also put things off, such as new reading material, and would end up 
cramming it at 2 A.M. With this, I also need to start my homework early so that I do not end up rushing to finish it. I can 
focus on the quality of my work, as well as allow myself some time to really understand the content (and if I'm lucky, explore 
the content beyond what is given).

Besides academics, I also need to be able to make some time to talk to my friends and walk around, instead of staying in my 
room all day. Especially in a time like this, where anxiety and stress run rampant, it is essential to have a support system 
that you can lean on, whether it is for emotional support or for a small friendly conversation.
