> The principles of the code do not constitute an algorithmic Turing machine that solves ethical problems. Professional 
judgments are still necessary.


You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, 
describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what 
is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?

In the realm of software engineering, 

Ethics is not something as clockwork as a computer. There are many fine lines and gray areas that software engineers must 
navigate through when designing, implementing and deploying and maintaining their applications. What is the purpose of the 
application, and what are the implications of it? Who will this application affect, and how will it affect them? What can I do 
to eradicate and/or prevent the harm that this project presents, and if there is  , what is the justification of that detail, 
and what can be done to minimize it?
A good software engineer must always consider the well-being of everyone around them, from their clients, to their colleagues, 
to their company, besides their own well-being. They must be able to 


## Case In Point: The Serial Swatter

In the case study regarding the harassment of users online and the actions that companies take to address these issues, the 
problem of a lack of intervention in cases of online harassment is brought to the forefront. One such case had been the case 
of the Serial Swatter, in which a sixteen year old from Canada known as Obnoxious had harassed other female Twitch streamers. 
His actions included sending disturbing and threatening messages to these streamers as well as being able to easily access 
these streamers personal information by calling Internet service providers and using a small piece of information about these 
streamers to obtain more information about them. Some of his other malicious actions ranged from sending strange pizzas to the 
streamer's house, to sending over a SWAT team to the streamer's home or school if they continued to ignore his messages. The 
reaction to the criminal was a slow and agonizing one on Twitch's end; several victims had reached out to Twitch to report 
Obnoxious's activities, but representatives had turned away these women, claiming that "in some cases, there is not a lot we 
can do when things happen off of our site," and in which a Twitch representative had responded to another user with "I 
sympathize for you going through that — best of luck to the police to catch the perpetrator!"

While Twitch had eventually formally addressed the case by including a section on swatting in their Education portal and 
providing information on protection from DDoS and other forms of harassment online, their reaction to the case was slow, and 
the way that the organization had responded to these victims showed that they were slow to consider the well-being of their 
stakeholders and were not acting for the good of the public. We must also question the ethics of the companies 
involved in these incidents, such as the various Internet companies that Obnoxious had called, to Amazon. The ease that 
Obnoxious had when calling these companies and obtaining information about these streamers calls into question the safety 
protocols that these Internet companies had at the time, and how flimsy they were. Such protocols and actions show that these 
companies did not consider the well-being and safety of their customers when handling their customers' information, a 
consideration that tops the lists of the Association for Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, as 
well as the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.

Another thing to note is how the things that we create as software engineers can also be used in a malicious manner. While VPNs are useful in the sense that 

In the 
case of Obnoxious, he had been able to mask his I.P. address using VPNs, making it harder for authorities to pinpoint the 
location of the swatter.



Software engineers must consider their stakeholders as their top priority, and in the long run

Looking at incidents such as the Serial Swatter, Gamergate, as well as the other occurrences of racial, sexual, religious and 
many other forms of harassment that occur online, companies must consider better protocols in terms of handling these cases. 
It was agonizing to read through the events leading up to Obnoxious's arrest, especially with how Twitch had tried to hide 
away from the situation instead of cooperating with authorities and these victims to eradicate the 
problem before it spiraled out of control.

While they may be dealing with millions upon millions of users, it is a tech company's reponsibility to understand that their 
users are real people, and that the problems that occur online are not only restricted to a screen. Online commerce
has become as routine as breathing to most of us: with the technology available to us today, our lives are intertwined with 
these social networking sites and online services one way or another. It's only right for tech companies to enforce their 
rules and maintain their protocols regarding user issues and harassment to ensure the safety and well-being of their users, as 
well as the integrity of the company and the employees involved.

- you can be the greatest programmer in the world, but without the right professional skills and ethics, those skills mean 
nothing
- Ethics = do I do it? Who will it affect
- Software engineering as a newer engineering discipline = finding its place amongst engineering ethics
- ethics should not be deemed as a checklist, it should be treated as an internal, mental aspect
  - need people experience, project management experience, communication, interaction, cultural exposure, etc.
- ethical codes are only the start of it = it's how you choose to practice and how often you practice these ideas, some 
experiences do not follow/blur amongst these laid out codes, in which it is up to you to use your judgement to maneuver 
through these situations in your professional life
- indicate the specific ethical duties that engineers of the highest professional standing expect their present and future 
colleagues to respect, and to fulfill
- strong sense of individual responsibility, acute awareness of the world around them, brutal honesty, resilience under 
pressure, a heightened sense of fairness, attention to detail while maintaining perspective, and pragmatism in applying 
professional standards
