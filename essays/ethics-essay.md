> The principles of the code do not constitute an algorithmic Turing machine that solves ethical problems. Professional 
judgments are still necessary.


- you can be the greatest programmer in the world, but without the right professional skills and ethics, those skills mean 
nothing
- Ethics = do I do it? Who will it affect
- Software engineering as a newer engineering discipline = finding its place amongst engineering ethics
- ethics should not be deemed as a checklist, it should be treated as an internal, mental aspect
  - need people experience, project management experience, communication, interaction, cultural exposure, etc.
- ethical codes are only the start of it = it's how you choose to practice and how often you practice these ideas, some 
experiences do not follow/blur amongst these laid out codes, in which it is up to you to use your judgement to maneuver 
through these situations in your professional life
- indicate the specific ethical duties that engineers of the highest professional standing expect their present and future 
colleagues to respect, and to fulfill
- strong sense of individual responsibility, acute awareness of the world around them, brutal honesty, resilience under 
pressure, a heightened sense of fairness, attention to detail while maintaining perspective, and pragmatism in applying 
professional standards
