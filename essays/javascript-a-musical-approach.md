### JavaScript: Learning A New Scale ###

I have to owe it to JavaScript since it was my first programming language.

While I did experience the language, I had only made it as far as learning about loops in Code Academy's JavaScript course before entering college. A year later, having experienced Java and C/C++, I noticed that it was way less strict than that of those which were statically typed. I had to stop myself from declaring the types of my variables while I was working on my freeCodeCamp exercises, and just let `var`, `const`, and `let` do their job. There were also concepts in the ES6 section, such as Promises, that were confusing to me. It will definitely take some practice to get comfortable with JavaScript. 


### WODs and Athletic Software Engineering: Practice, Practice Practice! ###
Athletic Software Engineering and Workout of the Day. First of all, it was intimidating. However, I find it very beneficial and essential to my growth as a programmer.  A strong programmer must have the ability to problem-solve under time constraints and have the mental discipline to practice and refine your craft. While I am a little stressed with the due dates of assignments being fairly close together, it's there to prepare me. Technology is evolving every day, so we must have the ability to adapt to these changes and fluctuations. We _have_ to make it look easy.

WODs reminded me a lot about how I would practice the oboe for auditions and music competitions for my high school's concert band. I like to think of the workouts as a technical excerpt or piece I was to work on. The computer is my instrument. freeCodeCamp was my warm-up. You only have a certain amount of time to "learn the piece" and work through the problem. It all boils down to the same virtue: the amount of practice time that you put in determines how well you do. Stop, and you develop "cold sores" that obstruct your programming abilities. Your fingers and mind won't cooperate, and you'll freeze up during your performance.

Improving one's skills requires daily practice, repetition is key! 

After all, the easy way out is not always the best way.
