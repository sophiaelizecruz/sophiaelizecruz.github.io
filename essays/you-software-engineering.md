## Really? Software Engineering? 

Several factors made me interested in software engineering. I took an engineering class alongside my graphics class during my senior year to replace my economics class. It was here that I became more interested in computers and computer science. To this day, I still regret not taking my teacher's offer to join my school's CyberPatriot team, all of that valuable training and experience! I was also able to enjoy math a lot more because of my trigonometry teacher, who made math look easy. It was then that I realized, that I wanted something that would allow me to feel the euphoric rush of solving problems while being able to display my creativity. 

My interests in software engineering are being able to learn new programming languages, as well as solving problems. I like to see how each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. I also like learning about how the concepts that we learn in class apply to everyday applications, and the languages that these applications are coded in. I also like solving puzzles and would also like to improve my project management skills and want to work on balancing the technical aspects with the social aspects of software engineering.

## So, What Now?

Software engineering, while challenging, is an exciting class, and I hope that at the end of it, I will be able to work smarter, not harder. I want to be able to develop software and design websites, and for that, I hope to learn as much as I can from this class. I am also excited to be working with a lot of other technologies and software. At the same time, we are being taught multiple soft skills, such as time and project management skills to developing a professional persona through strengthening our writing skills and creating a technical portfolio. I'm very eager to strengthen my programming skills and for the challenges that lie ahead.
