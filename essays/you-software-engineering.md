## Wait a minute, computer science? Software engineering? All that math? And stress?

I had gotten a lot of those types of remarks that after I had chosen to major in computer science since I was in the arts and communication track in high school, I loved band, and would often post my art on my social media. If anything, people thought that I was going to major in marketing or that I was going to focus on 2D/3D Animation. Before my senior year of high school, that's what I thought too.

Several factors influenced my decision. I took an engineering class alongside my graphics class during my senior year to replace my economics class. (I wanted to take electronics, but I had a time conflict!) It was here that I became more interested in computer science. (To this day, I still regret not taking my teacher's offer to join my school's CyberPatriot team, all of that valuable training and experience!) I was also able to enjoy math a lot more because of my trigonometry teacher, who made math feel like my very best friend. It was then that I realized, that I wanted something that would allow me to feel the euphoric rush of solving problems and puzzles while being able to display my creativity. 

## So, What Now?

Coming to UH Manoa and entering the CS program, I had nothing but some knowledge of JavaScript and advice from older friends. It was a struggle at times, especially with the fact that most of my friends had dropped out of the program by the time ICS 211 came around. I can remember that day where my dad had told me those harsh words: "I don't think that you're cut out for something like this. Change while you can." 

But I was willing to learn. _And I still am._

Software engineering, while challenging, is an exciting class. I want to be able to develop software and design websites, and for that, I hope to learn as much as I can from this class. At the same time, we are being taught multiple soft skills, from time management to developing a professional persona. I'm very eager to strengthen my programming skills and for the challenges that lie ahead.
