For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three 
of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of 
Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style 
for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project 
Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. 
You must define these terms if you are using them.

Open Source Software Development
Configuration Management
Functional Programming
Development Environments
Coding Standards
User Interface Frameworks
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns
Ethics in Software Engineering
