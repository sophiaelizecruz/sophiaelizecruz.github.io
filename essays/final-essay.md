For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three 
of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of 
Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style 
for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project 
Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. 
You must define these terms if you are using them.


## Welcome to the End

Coming into 314, I was very excited to experience a building an application with a group and working on my web development 
skills. While it took some time to get used to, I ended up looking forward to the Workout of the Day as it allowed me to 
practice and demonstrate what I had learned from the module. The class was fast-paced and intense at times, but that's to be 
expected of a 300-level class, and I honestly enjoyed every minute of the class. During my free time, I found 
myself wanting to make my own sites and planning projects to do over the summer to practice the skills that I acquired, such 
as wanting to designing a website for my high school's band and orchestra program. Besides the technical aspects of the class, 
I was happy that we were able to develop our professional personas by developing our technical portfolio and exercising our 
project management, communication, and problem-solving skills. Writing these technical essays helped me to review the content 
from the modules, as well as utilize tools such as Grammarly to improve my writing. Developing my technical portfolio also 
helped me to prepare for another program that I had taken this semester, which focused on resume/cover letter development and 
other career-related aspects.

Functional Programming
- style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the 
evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data
- JavaScript
  - functions as values, arguments to other functions, return value of functions
 - Function treated like a string, Integer, just another data object
 -utilities that return functions
 -underscore library implements these utilities for javascript
 - reading in data, filtering, mapping
Development Environments
- IDE = integrated development environment, software development tool with following properties
- language aware editing
- project definition facilities
- integrated compilation
- a debugger (integrated stepwise execution)
- integration with configuration management
- refactoring = code readability, simplify structure
- Examples of IDEs include Emacs, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Xcode, JBuilder, Idea
Note pads not considered IDEs
- more complicated and take time to master
- slower
But
- can understand large software systems faster and correct them faster
- improve them faster

## So Many Environments to Choose From!

The beauty of integrated development environements is that as a developer, you are equipped with a system that makes 
understanding large software systems and debugging them much faster and is more efficient than using non-IDEs such as TextPad 
or NotePad. There are many integrated development environments to choose from such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Idea, which 
I have worked with, and I know a lot of people that like to use Visual Studio. With IDEs, they provide support for coding and 
allow you to navigate through your code with ease, from code completion and "quick-fixing" that aids you in searching for 
errors and warnings. These environments also support testing such as setting up and executing unit tests, as well as debugging 
where you can trace your code and find any errors with ease. When all's said and done, the environment also provides code 
refactoring, which allows you to rename variables, method, classes, and package names that may appear in hundreds of files in 
your application and helps to improve readability. While it may seem complicated to use and slower than NotePad or TextPad, it 
will ultimately benefit you in the long run. From the semantics to the aesthetics of your code, these environments have your 
back as you develop you applications and systems. There's many to choose from, so it's essential to find one based on the 
application's domain and the technology stack that you are using.

   
Coding Standards
- syntactic sugar
- readability
- knowing how to efficiently problem solve
- ESLint
  - detect and remove basic anti-patterns or generic coding mistakes associated with a language or library
User Interface Frameworks
- fonts, HTML5, CSS
- UI frameworks = provides a set of CSS classes and Javascript functions that simplify the development of 
the layout
- provide and attractive look and feel
- provide consistent results across browsers
- support for interaction
- jQuery, Bootstrap
- Bootstrap = well designed, open source UI framework, CSS wrappers for many javascript compoenents
- "set of classes and interfaces that define the elements and behavior of a window-based UI Subsystem"
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns
Ethics in Software Engineering
- for the good of others
