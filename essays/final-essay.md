For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three 
of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of 
Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style 
for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project 
Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. 
You must define these terms if you are using them.

- more efficient problem solving
- more skills beyond what i had conceived

Functional Programming
- style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the 
evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data
- JavaScript
  - functions as values, arguments to other functions, return value of functions
 - Function treated like a string, Integer, just another data object
 -utilities that return functions
 -underscore library implements these utilities for javascript
 - reading in data, filtering, mapping
Development Environments
- IDE = integrated development environment, software development tool with following properties
- language aware editing
- project definition facilities
- integrated compilation
- a debugger (integrated stepwise execution)
- integration with configuration management
- refactoring = code readability, simplify structure
- Examples of IDEs include Emacs, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Xcode, JBuilder, Idea
Note pads not considered IDEs
- more complicated and take time to master
- slower
But
- can understand large software systems faster and correct them faster
- improve them faster
Basic IDE features
- Support for coding 
- navigation through code
  - code completion, "quick fix"
  - background compilation
  -support for testing, unit tests
  - debugging = tracing and simple stepping
  - support for refactoring
rename variables, method, class, package name
best IDE depends on application domain and technology stack
   
Coding Standards
- syntactic sugar
- readability
- knowing how to efficiently problem solve
- ESLint
  - detect and remove basic anti-patterns or generic coding mistakes associated with a language or library
User Interface Frameworks
- fonts, HTML5, CSS
- UI frameworks = provides a set of CSS classes and Javascript functions that simplify the development of 
the layout
- provide and attractive look and feel
- provide consistent results across browsers
- support for interaction
- jQuery, Bootstrap
- Bootstrap = well designed, open source UI framework, CSS wrappers for many javascript compoenents
- "set of classes and interfaces that define the elements and behavior of a window-based UI Subsystem"
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns
Ethics in Software Engineering
- for the good of others
