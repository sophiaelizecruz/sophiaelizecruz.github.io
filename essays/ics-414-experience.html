## Revisiting the Fundamentals



## Think Of The Customer

This class has taught me to step back at times, move away from a progammer mindset and consider the customer's perspective. There was a constant scenario that I 
would think about throughout the process: I'm a random Joe or Jill on the street being asked to try out this greenhouse gas tracker. The regular Joe or Jill would 
not want to be squinting at multiple graphs to figure out the difference between their carbon emissions for today versus yesterday. Personally, I love interactive 
applications: aesthetically pleasing animations and widgets, easy-to-read graphs. Something that is easy to use and easy to understand. One of the biggest takeaways 
from this class was maintaining a customer-developer balance. A developer can produce an application with a lot of fancy graphs, complicated widgets and 
functionalities, but if it is not tailored towards the audience that you are developing the application for, then all of the work that is done is for nothing. 
Meeting with the customer every two to three weeks helped in maintaining this mindset: something that I kept in mind was how they appreciated the simplicity in a 
lot of the components in each of the teams' applications.

I feel that I have definitely come a long way from my first year where I had little to no programming experience, but at the same time, I have a lot to learn. At first, it was intimidating to move away from the shadow of the Meteor template that we had forked as well as the safety nets of the introductory software engineering course, so moving forward I want to expose myself to more frameworks and open source tools.
