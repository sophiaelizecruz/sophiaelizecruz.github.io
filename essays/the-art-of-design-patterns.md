When thinking about design patterns, a lot of people immediately think about the aesthetics in terms of art and refer to 
principles of design that leans more art and graphic design. However, in software engineering and in a lot of disciplines 
where you would least expect it, design patterns are an integral part to the success and functionality of the projects that 
engineers produce and maintain. When implementing these applications, software engineers refer to certain aspects of design in 
order to produce a system that is efficient, organized, and makes the development process run smoother by referring to certain 
design patterns.

Design patterns are solutions that can be reused to commonly occurring problems in software design, and provide a sense of 
organization and elegance during the development process. When describing a design pattern, a software engineer must recognize 
what their task is, consider the patterns relevant to the task at hand that can be used to solve the problem, and from there, 
weigh out the positive and negative consequences for each possible solution. We are able to understand and view the 
relationships and interactions between objects and classes, and some of these patterns include the creation of objects, how we 
represent collections of objects, as well as how these objects behave by themselves and with other objects with each pattern. 
Some common examples of design patterns are factory, singleton, observer, and the model-view-controller problem, in which the 
model-view problem has different approaches such as the model-view-adapter (MVA).

In introductory computer science classes, students will more often than not encounter the factory and singleton pattern. The 
factory pattern provides the leisure of being able to return objects associated with different classes, and in a sense, that 
provides a level of efficiency. However, we must consider that despite the its welcoming nature, it can be more complicated 
than an object-oriented class constructor. Another common pattern that new students encounter is the singleton pattern, in 
which it provides a global variable to an object oriented language that would otherwise not support global 
variables or a complex global state. Alongside that, singletons only allow one instance of a class to to exist. While it does 
allow developers to implement lazy inititalization, the use of singletons and global variables in practice is unwise, and is 
not thread-safe, so new programmers should be careful to not develop a bad habit of relying on this pattern.

Some of the other patterns that a software engineer may encounter is the observer pattern that is common in event-driven systems such that you must provide one or more "event-handlers," 

## The Solution: "Think Like A Computer Scientist"

While design patterns may seem intimidating, it is just a matter of adapting to a certain mentality when approaching the 
problem. Having used singletons and factory patterns in introductory courses, I now see how knowing and practicing these 
patterns constantly will help the development and design process go by much smoother. By experiencing these design patterns 
through classes and projects outside of them, you are essentially developing a toolbelt of tips and tricks that you can apply 
to similar situtations that you may encounter in the future. 

Design Patterns are essentially finding 

-Design patterns: Creational, Structural, Behavorial
- Recognizing problems that occur over and over again and describing/finding a solution that you can use over and over again 
without ever doing the same thing twice
- efficiency
- Name, Problem, Solution, Consequences
  - is there an efficient, better solution out there than the one I have now?
- reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design
- OO Design Patterns specify relationships between classes and objects without specifying final application of classes or 
objects
- have to have experience
- develop a certain mindset
- some design patterns are Factory, Singleton, Observer, Model-View-Controller
- going beyong OO Design
- MVC


A common interview question is “What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

For this technical essay, you will write an interesting and informative technical essay that 
ends up answering these two questions.
