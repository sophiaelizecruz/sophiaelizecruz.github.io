When thinking about design patterns, a lot of people immediately think about the aesthetics in terms of art and refer to 
principles of design that leans more art and graphic design. However, in software engineering and in a lot of disciplines 
where you would least expect it, design patterns are an integral part to the success and functionality of the projects that 
engineers produce and maintain. When implementing these applications, software engineers refer to certain aspects of design in 
order to produce a system that is efficient, organized, and makes the development process run smoother by referring to certain 
design patterns.

Design patterns are solutions that can be reused to commonly occurring problems in software design, and provide a sense of 
organization and elegance during the development process. When describing a design pattern, a software engineer must recognize 
what their task is, consider the patterns relevant to the task at hand that can be used to solve the problem, and from there, 
weigh out the positive and negative consequences for each possible solution.

In introductory computer science classes, many students will encounter the Singleton class, in which it provides a global 
variable to an object oriented language that would otherwise not support global variables or a complex global state. 
Alongside that, singletons only allow one instance of a class to to exist. While it does allow developers to implement lazy 
inititalization, the use of singletons and global variables in practice is unwise, and is not thread-safe. 

While design patterns may seem intimidating, it is just a matter of adapting to a certain mentality when approaching the 
problem. By experiencing these design patterns through classes and projects outside of them, you are essentially 
developing a toolbelt of tips and tricks that you can apply to similar situtations that you may encounter in the future. 

Design Patterns are essentially finding 

-Design patterns: Creational, Structural, Behavorial
- Recognizing problems that occur over and over again and describing/finding a solution that you can use over and over again 
without ever doing the same thing twice
- efficiency
- Name, Problem, Solution, Consequences
  - is there an efficient, better solution out there than the one I have now?
- reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design
- OO Design Patterns specify relationships between classes and objects without specifying final application of classes or 
objects
- have to have experience
- develop a certain mindset
- some design patterns are Factory, Singleton, Observer, Model-View-Controller
- going beyong OO Design
- MVC


A common interview question is “What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

For this technical essay, you will write an interesting and informative technical essay that 
ends up answering these two questions. 
By doing so, you’ll be better prepared to answer this question if it comes up in an interview.
