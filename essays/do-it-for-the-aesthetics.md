UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. 
Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time 
and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

## Yeah, why bother using something like Semantic UI?
UI Frameworks can definitely be difficult to understand, but they prove to be very useful and make designing web pages a lot more convenient. Semantic UI, being powered by jQuery and LESS, is one of these UI Frameworks, 

Semantic UI makes front-end development easier for software engineers as you can group compenents together 
instead of having to track more tags with raw HTML and CSS. This also provides a sense of ease when browsing through your 
code. As long as a person takes the time to understand the the framework, then learning Semantic UI is not as 
challenging as it seems. The amount of time that is put into understanding this framework may be a lot and it may seem tedious 
and frustrating, but the skills you learn will definitely save you some time in your projects down the road.


## Easy, Breezy, Beautiful (We're getting there.)

With Semantic UI, I feel that it has made designing webpages a lot easier and has allowed me to focus more on the smaller 
design details such as aesthetics and other graphic design concepts. It is easier to to keep track of the tags and the 
grouping of components also simplifies things as well. In the beginning, I was not very enthusiastic about Semantic UI because 
of the videos that we had to watch, but after getting my hands dirty by trying it out for myself, I enjoy using it and began 
to experiment with all of the tools and elements available to me. I was able to understand concepts that were fuzzy to me such 
as CSS selectors. I especially enjoyed the task where we had to rebuild a page of our choice, especially with trying to figure 
out how to lay out each of the elements, and found myself wanting more time to better understand how to incorporate 
transitions and animations through JavaScript so I could include them in my page. I now have a better appreciation for 
Semantic UI and would love to try new UI Frameworks so I could see how they compare to Semantic UI.
