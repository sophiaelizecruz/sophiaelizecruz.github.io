UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. 
Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time 
and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

## Yeah, why bother to use something like Semantic UI?

I think that Semantic UI makes the design process easier for software engineers as you can group compenents together instead and having to track less tags compared to raw HTML and CSS. This also provides a sense of ease when searching through the code. 
I believe that
-convenience
-easier to read
-raw html and css time consuming and can be confusing
-easier to group classes together

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. 
You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. 
Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to 
read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

With Semantic UI, I feel that it has made designing webpages a lot easier and has allowed me to focus more on the smaller design details such as aesthetics and other graphic design concepts. It is easier to track the tags as well as group components together. 

In the beginning, I was not very enthusiastic to watch through the videos, but

I now have a better appreciation for Semantic UI and UI Frameworks overall.

-semantic ui is much more convenient
-can track classes easier
-watching the videos was tedious but has made designing web pages a lot more understandable and easier
-excited to apply graphic design concepts that i had learned in high school
