> The principles of the code do not constitute an algorithmic Turing machine that solves ethical problems. Professional 
judgments are still necessary.

## "The Good Life"

Ethics is not something as clockwork as a computer. There are many fine lines and gray areas that software engineers must 
navigate through when designing, implementing, deploying, and maintaining their applications. What is the purpose of the 
application, and what are the implications of it? Who will this application affect, and how will it affect them? What can I do 
to eradicate and/or prevent the harm that this project presents and if harm is an intentional part of the system, what is 
the justification for including it, and what can be done to minimize it? These are only a few of the many questions that 
software engineers will encounter in their line of work.

A good software engineer must always consider the well-being of everyone around them, from their clients to their colleagues, 
to their company. Besides having technical skills, software engineers must also be proficient with their soft skills. This 
includes being able to communicate with their colleagues efficiently as well as knowing when to be brutally honest when a 
decision could potentially harm your stakeholders. A good software engineer must also be able to embrace the experiences that 
they encounter. To really understand how the application that you are developing will affect the people around you, it is 
important for software engineers to learn about the world and expose themselves to different cultures and people.

Software engineering, like any other profession, must be responsible for their own growth, and rather than judging and 
criticizing others, and should take the time to see if they are upholding the values and morals that they believe in. This 
involves being able to be resilient while under pressure, and if things take a turn for the worst, they must have the ability 
to take responsibility for their actions. They should also strive to provide their customers with systems that are safe and 
efficient by paying attention to details and not cutting corners with their code. Finally, a software engineer should be aware 
of their limits and technical capabilities, as their pride could ultimately bring about great harm to the people around them.

All in all, a software engineer must always perform to the best of their ability, and they must have the drive to improve the 
lives of the people who use their systems. Unfortunately, with the pace that our systems and technologies are evolving, good 
morals and practices are slowly being left on the backburner.

## The Wake Up Call: The Case of the Serial Swatter 

In the case study regarding the harassment of users online and the actions that companies take to address these issues, the 
problem of a lack of intervention in cases of online harassment is brought to the forefront. One such case had been the case 
of the Serial Swatter, in which a sixteen-year-old from Canada known as Obnoxious had harassed other female Twitch streamers. 
His actions included sending disturbing and threatening messages to these streamers as well as being able to easily access 
these streamers' personal information by calling Internet service providers and using a small piece of information about these 
streamers to obtain more information about them. Some of his other malicious actions ranged from sending strange pizzas to the 
streamer's house, to sending over a SWAT team to the streamer's home or school if they continued to ignore his messages. The 
reaction to the criminal was a slow and agonizing one on Twitch's end; several victims had reached out to Twitch to report 
Obnoxious's activities, but representatives had turned away these women, claiming that "in some cases, there is not a lot we 
can do when things happen off of our site," and in which a Twitch representative had responded to another user with "I 
sympathize for you going through that â€” best of luck to the police to catch the perpetrator!"

While Twitch had eventually formally addressed the case by including a section on swatting in their Education portal and 
providing information on protection from DDoS and other forms of harassment online, their reaction to the case was slow, and 
the way that the organization had responded to these victims showed that they were slow to consider the well-being of their 
stakeholders and were not acting for the good of the public. We must also question the ethics of the companies 
involved in these incidents, such as the various Internet companies that Obnoxious had called, to Amazon. The ease that 
Obnoxious had when calling these companies and obtaining information about these streamers calls into question the safety 
protocols that these Internet companies had at the time, and how flimsy they were. Such protocols and actions show that these 
companies did not consider the well-being and safety of their customers when handling their customers' information, a 
consideration that tops the lists of the Association for Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, as 
well as the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.

Another thing to recognize is that while we may think that the applications and services that we use are well maintained, we 
undermind the idea that these things can be used against us. For example, while there are benefits to using a VPN such as a 
user's privacy and security, others may use it to conceal their malicious activities. In Obnoxious's case, he had been able to 
mask his I.P. address using VPNs, making it harder for authorities to pinpoint the location of the swatter.

## Looking to the Future

Looking back at incidents such as the Serial Swatter, Gamergate, as well as the  racial, sexual, religious, and other forms of 
harassment that occur online, companies should consider better protocols in terms of handling these cases. It was agonizing to 
read through the events leading up to Obnoxious's arrest, especially with how Twitch seemed to hide away from the 
situation only to finally address it when they were told about the magnitude of the case. I feel that they should have taken 
immediate action, cooperating with authorities and these victims to eradicate the problem before it spiraled out of control. 
Some companies have some protocols installed for users to report harassment and other shady activities online, but the 
handling of these cases may have mixed results: in reaching out to a social media company regarding some threats that they had 
received online, the user had sent multiple emails and tickets to the company, but had not heard anything from them.

While they may be dealing with millions upon millions of users, it is a tech company's responsibility to understand that their 
users are real people. The use of technology and the internet has become as routine as breathing to most of us: with the 
the technology available to us today, our lives are intertwined with these social networking sites and online services one way 
or another. It's only right for tech companies to enforce their rules and maintain their protocols regarding user issues and 
harassment to ensure the safety and well-being of their users, as well as the integrity of the company and the employees 
involved.
