## Darn! That One Curly Bracket!

It's that one curly brace or character, or a simple misspelling or a function or variable name that ends up messing up your 
program. For any beginner, it's easy to develop bad habits. With programming, such bad habits could be code formatting and
taking things at face value rather than understanding the steps that a program or algorithm takes to do what it does.
They also tend to code right away, instead of taking the time to draft out their ideas and figure out how it applies to the 
problem that they are to solve. These bad habits can eventually snowball into larger problems down the road if not corrected 
early on. Simple things, such as spending the time to delve into hundreds of lines of messy code just to find that you were 
missing a character or symbol, or wasting your time trying to search for methods for your program. By establishing a high 
standard for yourself and how you code early on, you are setting yourself apart from other programmers who lack a sense of 
discipline for their coding standards.

I think that some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language, and is an essential
software engineering technique to improve the quality of your programs. In a very trivial sense, 
especially with languages that share similar qualities, it would definitely help you when trying to navigate through 
understanding syntax errors. But on a broader scale, I think that "coding standards" can also be knowing how to implement
certain simple algorithms and procedures, as well as understanding how it works, why it works, and other ways that you can 
approach the problem. Anyone can place those squiggly braces and semi-colons in the right place, but they mean nothing if the 
semantics of your program is not right. By understanding how a program is supposed to work, this helps you out with learning 
the language. I think that having the balance between coding style as well as being able to organize your thinking and your 
problem-solving process is what defines a good set of coding standards, and is what helps you to learn a programming language.

## The Green Check: It Has Your Back!

Using ESLint with IntelliJ has made coding much easier for me as it's easier to pinpoint errors such as missing semi-colons,
missing brackets, and other issues related to syntax. ESLint really helps me to understand the Javascript syntax a lot more,
as it guides you as you get your hands dirty with coding, and has helped me to become a little more nitpicky about the format
of the code, as well as with the coding style. I do like that I have a crutch so that it takes away from the time that I use 
to figure out those types of errors, but at the same time, I can see how people can get lazy and click away, without trying to 
recognize what problems they were having. I hope to not to become too dependent on it and I try to recognize these errors and 
understand why and how they occur so that I can avoid them in the future and not waste time having to fix them.
